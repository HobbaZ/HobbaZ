<h2 align = "center">Coding Bootcamp</h2>

In February 2022 I completed a 6 month 240 hour full stack web developer bootcamp run in partnership with the University of Sydney/Trilogy. The course taught us, through weekly homework assignments and studying, the basics of HTML, CSS and JS all the way through to web security, React, configuring and utilising NPM packages, displaying and consumingg data from APIs, Node and much more. I've created a few projects with my new found skills, feel free to check out my repos.

<h2 align = "center">Interests</h2>
I'm interested in dynamically and procedurally created content and would like to eventually learn about AI/ML and AR/VR tech.
