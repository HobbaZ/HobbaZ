<h2 align = "center">Coding Bootcamp</h2>

I've recently completed a 6 month intensive full stack web developer bootcamp run in partnership with the University of Sydney/Trilogy. The course taught us the basics of HTML and CSS all the way through to more advanced topics as web security, React, JS and utilising NPM packages. Using my knew found skillls, I've created a few projects, which you can checkout [here](https://zachobbawebdev.herokuapp.com/), you can also check out my current project I'm working on [here](https://worthly.herokuapp.com/)
