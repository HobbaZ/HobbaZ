## The Before Times

I've attempted to learn coding on and off for a few years, starting with Unity game engine in highschool, then a bit of basic web dev in Notepad at university, before moving on to a 10 year old Python textbook and a 20 year old Javascript textbook that I discovered in an op-shop. I found I could make the things I wanted to make, but they were buggy, disorganised and held together with the coding equivalent of ducktape and hotwired with hopes and dreams (and they're all on Github for your viewing pleasure), somehow they compile, and what's even more horrifying is that they actually work. 

## Coding Bootcamp

Fortunately I came to my senses and decided I needed some structure to my 'learning', I enrolled in a 6 month full stack web developer bootcamp run in partnership with the University of Sydney/Trilogy and I expect to finish in Feb 2022. Already my coding has vastly improved, now with added features like proper structure, coding conventions and a solid understanding of rudimentary basics, as I progress I'll only get better and more excited about where my journey will take me and what I'll create.
